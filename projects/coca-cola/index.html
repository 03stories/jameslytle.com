<p>How prepared is a country to introduce a Coca Cola liquid food product into their market? This is a tough question to answer for product leaders from so many different perspectives and cultures.</p>
<p><strong>Goal:</strong> Measure progress on the development of Fit for Purpose Operating Models through Liquid Food product category assessments that illustrate capabilities on a maturity scale.</p>
<p><strong>Key Story:</strong>  Differentiated LF business processes, successful practices, and experts emerge around LF maturity as visibility increases and a shared language is encouraged.</p>
<h1>Process</h1>
<p><em>Defining the Problem</em></p>
<p>The project began with research and requirements gathering, via kickoff meetings and a couple follow up remote calls. After asking a thousand (?!) clarifying questions about verbiage across spreadsheets and goals conversations, I ended up with a clear enough picture to define the problem space and begin to organize the general goal areas of the report.</p>
<p>The following output of this stage serves a few purposes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Double check that we heard everything correctly, and we're all saying the same thing</li>
<li>Organize problems to solve into meaningful categories</li>
<li>Present a <em>sample</em> visual example of how this maps to solving a use case</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Ideas</em></p>
<p>After the understanding and goals were affirmed, I could move into developing concepts. I ended up with 3 concepts worth presenting to discuss the tradeoffs of each design direction with the client.</p>
<p><em>Concept 1</em>
