I love designing beautiful, useful data products, inside and out. My goal is simply to help people communicate their complex data more fluently to their non-analytical audiences.

Collaborating with diverse teams, I'm passionate about turning imaginative design concepts into pragmatic solutions that solve real problems for real people. Constraints are good, and for me, the best technique or tool in the process is the one that works<sup>(1)</sup>.

I've worked with the mainstays like Coca-Cola, IHG, and Healthstream, as well as slightly fresher startups like TrueCar, IRUNURUN, and Medikly.
