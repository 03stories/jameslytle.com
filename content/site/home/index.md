greeting: "Hi! I’m James Lytle, a Product & UX Design Generalist"

This site shows my [project work](/projects), [process](/projects/design-docs), and some [other things](/other-things) I’m into. Currently, I'm a Senior Product Designer for Juice Analytics, where I focus on enhancing how people communicate and understand data<sup>(1)</sup>. My projects include consulting with companies like [Coca-Cola](/projects/coca-cola) and [Silverpop](/projects/silverpop), as well as leading the design on two data platform products. The more recent one is dubbed [Juicebox](/projects/juicebox), and it’s the best solution<sup>(2)</sup> for presenting data stories at scale to business customers.

### Notes

1. It’s way more confusing than it needs to be!
2. But, of course, I’m biased.
